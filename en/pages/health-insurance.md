# Health Insurance

Germany has a reputation for having one of the best health care systems in the world. As an employee, it is mandatory to have a German health insurance, being it public health insurance or private health insurance. Around 90% of the German population are members of the public health scheme. Applying for private health insurance is more complicated and the process is not yet covered by this guide.

This guide provides a brief summary of how to apply for public health insurance, but I also strongly recommend that you read the following websites for more information:

## Public health insurance

The cost of the public health insurance (*gesetzliche Krankenversicherung*) is 14.6% to 15.6% of your salary, but your employer pays the first 7.3%.

Everyone is allowed to use public health insurance. Employees who make below a certain income (60750€ in 2019) *must* use public health insurance. Freelancers and those who earn more than 60750€ can choose private health insurance instead.

With public health insurance, spouses/civil partners and children can also be insured at no extra costs, if they make less than 450€ per month.

Applying for public health insurance is relatively stress free, as it can generally be done online and in English. Before you apply, you must first choose your health insurance provider (*Krankenkasse*). All *Krankenkassen* are non-profit organisations. Here are the most popular:

 - TK - [https://www.tk.de/tk/english/610312](https://www.tk.de/tk/english/610312)
 - AOK - [http://en.zuwanderer.aok.de/home/](http://en.zuwanderer.aok.de/home/)
 - BEK - [https://www.jetzt-zur-barmer-gek-wechseln.de/en](https://www.jetzt-zur-barmer-gek-wechseln.de/en)
 - DAK - [https://www.dak.de/dak/mitglied_werden/Health_Insurance-1283602.html](https://www.dak.de/dak/mitglied_werden/Health_Insurance-1283602.html)

After you choose your health insurance provider, you can contact them to get more information on how to apply.

I ended up choosing TK, as they are one of the most famous *Krankenkassen* and offer good English support. If you want to apply for TK simply send an email to "service@tk.de" saying that you would like to apply. Don't forget to mention your spouse and children.

Shortly after you send your email, you will receive a form that you will have to fill out and send back to them. If you are married or have kids and plan to apply for them as well, it might be required that you send your marriage certificate (or birth certificate for your children). If you have any questions while filling out the form, feel free to ask in the comments section or email them directly, as they usually reply within minutes. You will also be required to send a biometric photo to them (you can scan it and send by email when they ask for it), which will be printed on your your health card.

You don't need to know all of this by heart. Your new *Krankenkasse* will always let you know if they need you to send a missing document.

Some days after your subscription you will receive a certificate (by email) and some weeks after your health insurance card:

## Private health insurance

Private health insurance [is only an option if you are *freiwillig versichert*](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/german-health-insurance#what-are-your-options) - voluntarily insured.

The price of private health insurance is based on your age and health condition. As you grow older, your monthly premiums will keep rising. Unlike public health insurance, which is priced according to your income, private health insurance will remain expensive if your salary goes down, or if your retire. It also costs extra to cover your spouse and your children.

On the bright side, privately insured patients get access to specialists much faster, and generally enjoy a slightly better service. Doctors love private patients, because they are more profitable.

Going with private health insurance only makes sense if you don't have or want children, or if you don't intend to stay in Germany forever. It can be very difficult to switch back to public health insurance, so make sure you understand the risks before going private.
